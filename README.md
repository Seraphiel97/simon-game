#Simon Game Overview
The player experience begins with a window where the title of the game, Simon, appears at the top of the screen. Below the title is a message that states, "Pay attention to the position and color of the squares below. You will have five seconds to study the grid before the colors will disappear and you will recreate the pattern yourself in the space provided. Good luck!"

Below the message is a grid of squares with a white background, indicating the game has not yet begun. At the bottom of the page is a button that says, "PLAY".

When the player clicks the button, the game begins and the background colors in the squares change to different colors based upon a randomly selected pattern. The computer selects from five colors to populate the grid.
