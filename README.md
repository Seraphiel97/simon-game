#Simon Game Overview

#Minimum Viable Product
The player experience begins with a window where the title of the game, Simon, appears at the top of the screen. Below the title is a message that states, "Pay attention to the color of the circle below. You will witness the colors change and then you will recreate the pattern yourself in the space provided. Good luck!"

Below the message is a large circle with a white background, indicating the game has not yet begun. At the bottom of the page is a button that says, "PLAY".

When the player clicks the button, the game begins and the background color in the circle changes to different colors based upon a randomly selected pattern. The computer selects from five colors to populate the circle.

After five seconds pass, the background color resets to white and new buttons and smaller circles appear throughout the page. Each of the circles have white backgrounds. Five buttons representing different colors appear below the circles. When pressed, the button changes the background of the selected circle to the color chosen. A "SUBMIT" button appears, which will check the player's solution to the game. The "PLAY" button is gone and is replaced by "PLAY AGAIN", which resets the game to its original state. 

If the player's choices correctly match the pattern they witnessed, a message appears declaring them a winner. If the player's choices do not match the correct solution, a message asks them to try again by clicking the "PLAY AGAIN" button at the bottom of the screen.
